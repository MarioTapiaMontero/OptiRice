##  Description 
Semi-supervised learning is a technique that deals with data that has both labeled and unlabeled instances. The goal is to use the information from the labeled data to predict the labeling of the unlabeled data. In this report, three different optimization Methods for semi-supervised learning on a synthetic dataset and a real dataset about rice seeds are used. In both datasets, just a small fraction of data with labels is kept. The performance of the Methods is evaluated based on their accuracy and time.
